I am a PhD in Accounting with research interests in corporate governance, disclosure, gender diversity, and financial performance.

My research focuses on credit cooperatives and emerging markets, employing quantitative methods such as OLS, 2SLS, Heckman selection models, and GMM estimators, as well as textual analysis using Python and R.
